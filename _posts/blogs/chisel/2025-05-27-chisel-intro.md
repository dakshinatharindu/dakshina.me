## Introduction
Chisel is a powerful hardware description language (HDL) that allows you to design complex digital circuits with ease. It provides a high-level abstraction for hardware design, making it easier to write, read, and maintain your code. In this blog post will guide you through the process of getting started with Chisel, from installation to writing your first Chisel module.

## Installation
You can use [chisel-template](https://github.com/dakshinatharindu/chisel-template.git) to get started with Chisel. This template provides a basic project structure and includes all the necessary dependencies to start writing Chisel code.

> Before you begin, make sure you have vscode and docker installed on your system. You can follow the [Getting Started with Docker](../docker-installation) blog post to install Docker on your system.

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Go to [chisel-template](https://github.com/dakshinatharindu/chisel-template.git) and click on the "Use this template" button to create a new repository. You can name it whatever you like, for example, `my-chisel-project`.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Open a terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-chisel-project.git
   cd my-chisel-project
   ```
3. **Open the Project in VSCode**: Open the cloned project in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
4. **Open Dev Container**: If you have the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed, you can open the project in a dev container. This will set up a development environment with all the necessary dependencies for Chisel.
   - Use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...".
   - Select the folder you cloned in step 2.
   - The first time you open the project in a dev container, it will take some time to build the container. Once the build is complete, you will have a fully functional Chisel development environment.
5. **Verify the Setup**: To verify that everything is set up correctly, you can run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
    sbt test
   ```
   This command will run the tests included in the project. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the tests passing without any errors.
